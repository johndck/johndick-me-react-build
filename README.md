## Description

This project creates some initial scaffolding for a first portfolio site. This portfolio site is a variation on the theme and will be pulling in my previous profession experience. I will be using this site for my personal site in the future.

The purpose of this site is not to secure a developer role. The purpose is to promote my skills which include coding now.

To note: this iteration of the portfolio site meets most of the technical requirements of the challenge. A number of pages have been created but have yet to be completed because they are not part of this challenge.

### What problem does the project solve?

The problem my portfolio site solves is providing professional answers for headhunters or recruiters to understand a little more about my professional background.

## Requirements mapping

Use mobile-first design ✅
Design does not look like bootstrap them ✅
React used ✅
Navigation uses React Router ✅
Portfolio contains name, links to Github, Email and Linkedin Profile ✅
‼️ I am not including my CV on my site as it contains sensitive personal information. The link to my Linkedin profile should be sufficient.
A list of projects of challenges ❌ - instead I have provided a series of cards on the past delivery page which are summary cards from previous employments/contracts.

My portfolio site contains 7 new components and 5 pages. You can see these in the components and pages folder.

My site does contain App, A Navbar (used across the site), A home page, Projects Page (is my past delivery page) and contact details are provided in my common Footer used across the site.

I do not have a contact form as I do not intend to use that.

The app is a top level component and does render all child components ✅
There is a header containing a Navbar which is re-used across the site ✅
The homepage covers all the requirement ✅
My projects page (past experience) creates instances of project card which imports details of projects from a json file. You can see the json file called deliveryList.json.
The site uses Router props to generate all of the project cards. ✅

## Testing

I have tested the site using a set of sim
